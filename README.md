Hereâ€™s a basic README template for your e-commerce backend project. You can customize it further as needed:

# E-Commerce Back End

## Description
This is the back-end for an e-commerce website built using Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL. It provides a RESTful API to interact with a PostgreSQL database and allows users to perform CRUD operations on categories, products, and tags.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ecommerce-backend
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up your `.env` file in the root directory with your PostgreSQL credentials:
   ```bash
   DB_NAME='your_database_name'
   DB_USER='your_postgres_username'
   DB_PASSWORD='your_postgres_password'
   ```

5. Create the database using the schema provided:
   ```bash
   psql -U <your_postgres_username> -d postgres -f db/schema.sql
   ```

6. Seed the database:
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```

## Usage
After setting up the database, you can start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

Once the server is running, you can interact with the API using tools like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). The following routes are available:

### Routes
- **Categories**
  - GET `/api/categories`: Get all categories and their associated products.
  - GET `/api/categories/:id`: Get a single category by ID, including its products.
  - POST `/api/categories`: Create a new category.
  - PUT `/api/categories/:id`: Update a category by its ID.
  - DELETE `/api/categories/:id`: Delete a category by its ID.

- **Products**
  - GET `/api/products`: Get all products, including their associated category and tags.
  - GET `/api/products/:id`: Get a single product by ID, including its category and tags.
  - POST `/api/products`: Create a new product (with optional tags).
  - PUT `/api/products/:id`: Update a product by its ID (with optional tags).
  - DELETE `/api/products/:id`: Delete a product by its ID.

- **Tags**
  - GET `/api/tags`: Get all tags and their associated products.
  - GET `/api/tags/:id`: Get a single tag by ID, including its products.
  - POST `/api/tags`: Create a new tag.
  - PUT `/api/tags/:id`: Update a tag by its ID.
  - DELETE `/api/tags/:id`: Delete a tag by its ID.

### Database Models
The database contains four models:
1. **Category**
   - `id`: Primary key, auto-incrementing integer.
   - `category_name`: String, cannot be null.
  
2. **Product**
   - `id`: Primary key, auto-incrementing integer.
   - `product_name`: String, cannot be null.
   - `price`: Decimal, must be a valid decimal number.
   - `stock`: Integer, default value is 10, must be numeric.
   - `category_id`: Foreign key, references the `Category` model.

3. **Tag**
   - `id`: Primary key, auto-incrementing integer.
   - `tag_name`: String.

4. **ProductTag**
   - `id`: Primary key, auto-incrementing integer.
   - `product_id`: Foreign key, references the `Product` model.
   - `tag_id`: Foreign key, references the `Tag` model.

### Example Data
To test the API, you can use the seed data provided in the `/seeds` directory.
